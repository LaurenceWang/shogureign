# Shogureign
Shogureign is an innovative mobile application, a serious game designed for learning kanjis (Sino-japanese characters).

Using the Tinder-like concept, the game enables players to swipe event cards to state their choices. The player is immersed in a captivating immersive story where he will play as a student in exchange in Japan. During this immersive adventure he will be confronted with different kanjis, by repetition and reflection he will gradually learn how to use them as well as their signification. To reinforce this learning process, he will have course cards as well as an evolving dictionary where he will be able to confirm or infirm his suppositions.
